###Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

Initial Training
What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: While predicting values,for the give datasets,i observed there were few negative value.To handle them i have replaced them with zero.

##What was the top ranked model that performed? 
TODO: WeightedEnsemble_L3 and NeuralNetFastAI_Bag_L2,before inclusion of new features(including all the data).


##What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: By performing EDA,it was observed that most of features like humudity,atemp has least effect on target variable,this was observed via heatmap.Applying QUICK MODEL from AWS Data Wrangling,it was clear that season,date has close relation. I have converted the datetime in years,months,days as new features.Discarted the features which having -ve values in heatmap. For example - on a rainy day,there will more numbers of bike will be rented compared to a sunny day.Only in peak hours.

##How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: My model accuracy incresed from 0.2764 to 0.6(For a specfic model used from AutoGluon.


##How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: By hypertuning ,i observe that r2 scored accelerated twice the initial score,i.e 0.4865.

If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: On EDA,because it's step where you can analysis dataset,clearly,and form a hypothesis.EDA gives us insights about the different variables have a connectivity with target variable.
Als0,hypertuning of parameters to make it more effecient and generic model.

Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.


Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.

Create a line plot showing the top kaggle score for the three (or more) prediction submissions during the project.

Summary
TODO: Working with AWS Sagemakers was itself a new experience.It was very handy to perform the most complex task in a simplfied manner.I learned new tools such as AutoML,Xgboost,AutoGluon.Data cleaning,EDA are the important stages in ML Life cycle.
